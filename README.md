# Data Exploration - Covid19 
This project explored and analyses Covid19 data to understand the statistics as of April 2023 and the forecast for specific countries. 
## The Dataset
The dataset was obtained from a [public database](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), and specific columns were extracted based on the requirement of the project. The dataset was exported in CSV files and imported into SSMS for analysis. 
## Analysis
The dataset was analysed using SQL queries in Microsoft SSMS. [See Script](https://github.com/Tomianne/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Covid%20Portfolio.sql). 
## Visualization
The resulting findings were visualised in Tableau. [See Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hannah.ajiboye/viz/CovidAnalysisDashboard_16908325293780/Dashboard1)
